        <h2>Focused Attention Meditation</h2>
        <p>It involves concentrating on a specific object, sound or stimulus as a way of staying in the present moment</br> as opposed to trying to clear your mind without a single point of focus.

            -> Second, after doing this do this at least for 20 minutes everyday.
        </br>-> After a year or so depending on your concentration, you can proceed to step3.
