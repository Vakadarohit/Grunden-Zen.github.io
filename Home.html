        We are all affected by stress. Although minimal stress is healthy, too much stress may wear you out and make you unwell, 
        both psychologically and physically. Stress is produced by your thoughts, not by the event. Stress is something that affects 
        many people each and every day. Life is full of hassles, deadlines, frustrations, and demands. For some people stress is so common it 
        is a way of life. Stress can be very harmful and or helpful. Stress is the combination of psychological, physiological, and behavioral
         reactions. Most people have a response to events that challenge or threaten them. Stress good and bad. Good stress is called eustress.
          According to Hans Selye, a series of physiological reactions to stress occurring in three phases. Those phases are alarm, resistance,
           and exhaustion. This is also known as the general adaptation syndrome. General adaptation describes the body's short-term and long-term 
           reaction.  There are many different things that causes stress but, stressors are the main provokes to stress. There are four common sources
            of stress: survival, internal, environmental, and fatigue of overwork.  It could help motivate you to meet a deadline and perform a task 
            under pressure. Stress can also be very harmful, such as memory problems, moodiness, aches and pains, and eating more or less. The greatest
             countermeasure against stress is our ability to choose one thought over another. Stress has many different symptoms the most often and 
             most common is having a headache. On your body the effects of stress are muscle tension or pain, chest pain, and fatigue. The effects of 
             stress on your mood is anxiety, restlessness, and lack of motivation or focus. Finally, the effects of stress on your behavior is 
             overeating or under eating, drug or alcohol abuse, and social withdraw. Since anyone at any age can be stressed there is no certain 
             population that is effected the most. I would say that teenagers get stressed easily due to school, spots and or jobs. The thing that 
             stresses most high school student out is picking and choosing what they are going to do after high school and what college they will be
              going to if any. People a little bit older after college could be stressed by trying to find a job or trying to find or support a family.
               Older people could be stressed if they are running out of money but besides that older people are probably the least stressful people in 
               are population. Our website will assist you by offering ideas on improving your fitness, Yoga, nutrition programmes, and so on. We also 
               provide stress-reduction techniques such as meditation and mind games.</p>
